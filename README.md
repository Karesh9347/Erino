# React Contact Management App

This project is a **Contact Management Application** built using **React** and **React Bootstrap**. It allows users to add, remove, update, and view contacts, all while providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.

### Features:
- **Add Contact**: Allows users to add new contacts to the list.
- **Remove Contact**: Users can delete contacts from the list.
- **Update Contact**: Edit details of an existing contact.
- **View All Contacts**: Displays a list of all contacts with the option to manage them.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes using **React Bootstrap** and **CSS media queries**.

### Tech Stack:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components for React, providing a responsive UI framework.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views (Add Contact, Remove Contact, etc.).
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the app.
